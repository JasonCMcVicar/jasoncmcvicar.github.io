        <p id="aboutme_p">Hi, I'm Jason McVicar. I'm a cartoonist and (future) software engineer.
          I grew up in Michigan and moved to Chicago about 13 years ago. I'm passionate about making comics and
          studying computer science. I've worked in the coffee industry for the past decade and half,
          and I'm hoping to transition out of that and apply my new skills in web development, where I'm certain I'll be
          able to find meaningful and fulfilling work on projects I enjoy.
          In the future I hope to use this site to connect with employers and other creatives.
          For the moment, this is serving as a great re-introduction to HTML and CSS layout. I think I've still
          got a long ways to go, but it's an ever-evolving and changing road forward. Please enjoy a sample panel
          from a recent comic strip of mine. And below that, you'll find a link to my resume. Thanks for stopping by!
